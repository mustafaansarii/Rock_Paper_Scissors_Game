1. Choose your move (rock, paper, or scissors) by typing it into the input box.
2. Press Enter or click the "Submit" button to make your choice.
3. The computer will randomly choose its move.
4. The game will determine the winner based on the moves chosen:
   - Rock crushes scissors (Rock wins)
   - Paper covers rock (Paper wins)
   - Scissors cut paper (Scissors win)
   - If both players choose the same move, it's a tie.
